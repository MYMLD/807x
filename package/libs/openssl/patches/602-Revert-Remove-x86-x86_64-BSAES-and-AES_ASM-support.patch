+# ====================================================================
+#
+# Version 4.3.
+#
+# You might fail to appreciate this module performance from the first
+# try. If compared to "vanilla" linux-ia32-icc target, i.e. considered
+# to be *the* best Intel C compiler without -KPIC, performance appears
+# to be virtually identical... But try to re-configure with shared
+# library support... Aha! Intel compiler "suddenly" lags behind by 30%
+# [on P4, more on others]:-) And if compared to position-independent
+# code generated by GNU C, this code performs *more* than *twice* as
+# fast! Yes, all this buzz about PIC means that unlike other hand-
+# coded implementations, this one was explicitly designed to be safe
+# to use even in shared library context... This also means that this
+# code isn't necessarily absolutely fastest "ever," because in order
+# to achieve position independence an extra register has to be
+# off-loaded to stack, which affects the benchmark result.
+#
+# Special note about instruction choice. Do you recall RC4_INT code
+# performing poorly on P4? It might be the time to figure out why.
+# RC4_INT code implies effective address calculations in base+offset*4
+# form. Trouble is that it seems that offset scaling turned to be
+# critical path... At least eliminating scaling resulted in 2.8x RC4
+# performance improvement [as you might recall]. As AES code is hungry
+# for scaling too, I [try to] avoid the latter by favoring off-by-2
+# shifts and masking the result with 0xFF<<2 instead of "boring" 0xFF.
+#
+# As was shown by Dean Gaudet, the above note turned out to be
+# void. Performance improvement with off-by-2 shifts was observed on
+# intermediate implementation, which was spilling yet another register
+# to stack... Final offset*4 code below runs just a tad faster on P4,
+# but exhibits up to 10% improvement on other cores.
+#
+# Second version is "monolithic" replacement for aes_core.c, which in
+# addition to AES_[de|en]crypt implements AES_set_[de|en]cryption_key.
+# This made it possible to implement little-endian variant of the
+# algorithm without modifying the base C code. Motivating factor for
+# the undertaken effort was that it appeared that in tight IA-32
+# register window little-endian flavor could achieve slightly higher
+# Instruction Level Parallelism, and it indeed resulted in up to 15%
+# better performance on most recent µ-archs...
+#
+# Third version adds AES_cbc_encrypt implementation, which resulted in
+# up to 40% performance improvement of CBC benchmark results. 40% was
+# observed on P4 core, where "overall" improvement coefficient, i.e. if
+# compared to PIC generated by GCC and in CBC mode, was observed to be
+# as large as 4x:-) CBC performance is virtually identical to ECB now
+# and on some platforms even better, e.g. 17.6 "small" cycles/byte on
+# Opteron, because certain function prologues and epilogues are
+# effectively taken out of the loop...
+#
+# Version 3.2 implements compressed tables and prefetch of these tables
+# in CBC[!] mode. Former means that 3/4 of table references are now
+# misaligned, which unfortunately has negative impact on elder IA-32
+# implementations, Pentium suffered 30% penalty, PIII - 10%.
+#
+# Version 3.3 avoids L1 cache aliasing between stack frame and
+# S-boxes, and 3.4 - L1 cache aliasing even between key schedule. The
+# latter is achieved by copying the key schedule to controlled place in
+# stack. This unfortunately has rather strong impact on small block CBC
+# performance, ~2x deterioration on 16-byte block if compared to 3.3.
+#
+# Version 3.5 checks if there is L1 cache aliasing between user-supplied
+# key schedule and S-boxes and abstains from copying the former if
+# there is no. This allows end-user to consciously retain small block
+# performance by aligning key schedule in specific manner.
+#
+# Version 3.6 compresses Td4 to 256 bytes and prefetches it in ECB.
+#
+# Current ECB performance numbers for 128-bit key in CPU cycles per
+# processed byte [measure commonly used by AES benchmarkers] are:
+#
+#		small footprint		fully unrolled
+# P4		24			22
+# AMD K8	20			19
+# PIII		25			23
+# Pentium	81			78
+#
+# Version 3.7 reimplements outer rounds as "compact." Meaning that
+# first and last rounds reference compact 256 bytes S-box. This means
+# that first round consumes a lot more CPU cycles and that encrypt
+# and decrypt performance becomes asymmetric. Encrypt performance
+# drops by 10-12%, while decrypt - by 20-25%:-( 256 bytes S-box is
+# aggressively pre-fetched.
+#
+# Version 4.0 effectively rolls back to 3.6 and instead implements
+# additional set of functions, _[x86|sse]_AES_[en|de]crypt_compact,
+# which use exclusively 256 byte S-box. These functions are to be
+# called in modes not concealing plain text, such as ECB, or when
+# we're asked to process smaller amount of data [or unconditionally
+# on hyper-threading CPU]. Currently it's called unconditionally from
+# AES_[en|de]crypt, which affects all modes, but CBC. CBC routine
+# still needs to be modified to switch between slower and faster
+# mode when appropriate... But in either case benchmark landscape
+# changes dramatically and below numbers are CPU cycles per processed
+# byte for 128-bit key.
+#
+#		ECB encrypt	ECB decrypt	CBC large chunk
+# P4		52[54]		83[95]		23
+# AMD K8	46[41]		66[70]		18
+# PIII		41[50]		60[77]		24
+# Core 2	31[36]		45[64]		18.5
+# Atom		76[100]		96[138]		60
+# Pentium	115		150		77
+#
+# Version 4.1 switches to compact S-box even in key schedule setup.
+#
+# Version 4.2 prefetches compact S-box in every SSE round or in other
+# words every cache-line is *guaranteed* to be accessed within ~50
+# cycles window. Why just SSE? Because it's needed on hyper-threading
+# CPU! Which is also why it's prefetched with 64 byte stride. Best
+# part is that it has no negative effect on performance:-)
+#
+# Version 4.3 implements switch between compact and non-compact block
+# functions in AES_cbc_encrypt depending on how much data was asked
+# to be processed in one stroke.

+######################################################################
+# Timing attacks are classified in two classes: synchronous when
+# attacker consciously initiates cryptographic operation and collects
+# timing data of various character afterwards, and asynchronous when
+# malicious code is executed on same CPU simultaneously with AES,
+# instruments itself and performs statistical analysis of this data.
+#
+# As far as synchronous attacks go the root to the AES timing
+# vulnerability is twofold. Firstly, of 256 S-box elements at most 160
+# are referred to in single 128-bit block operation. Well, in C
+# implementation with 4 distinct tables it's actually as little as 40
+# references per 256 elements table, but anyway... Secondly, even
+# though S-box elements are clustered into smaller amount of cache-
+# lines, smaller than 160 and even 40, it turned out that for certain
+# plain-text pattern[s] or simply put chosen plain-text and given key
+# few cache-lines remain unaccessed during block operation. Now, if
+# attacker can figure out this access pattern, he can deduct the key
+# [or at least part of it]. The natural way to mitigate this kind of
+# attacks is to minimize the amount of cache-lines in S-box and/or
+# prefetch them to ensure that every one is accessed for more uniform
+# timing. But note that *if* plain-text was concealed in such way that
+# input to block function is distributed *uniformly*, then attack
+# wouldn't apply. Now note that some encryption modes, most notably
+# CBC, do mask the plain-text in this exact way [secure cipher output
+# is distributed uniformly]. Yes, one still might find input that
+# would reveal the information about given key, but if amount of
+# candidate inputs to be tried is larger than amount of possible key
+# combinations then attack becomes infeasible. This is why revised
+# AES_cbc_encrypt "dares" to switch to larger S-box when larger chunk
+# of data is to be processed in one stroke. The current size limit of
+# 512 bytes is chosen to provide same [diminishingly low] probability
+# for cache-line to remain untouched in large chunk operation with
+# large S-box as for single block operation with compact S-box and
+# surely needs more careful consideration...
+#
+# As for asynchronous attacks. There are two flavours: attacker code
+# being interleaved with AES on hyper-threading CPU at *instruction*
+# level, and two processes time sharing single core. As for latter.
+# Two vectors. 1. Given that attacker process has higher priority,
+# yield execution to process performing AES just before timer fires
+# off the scheduler, immediately regain control of CPU and analyze the
+# cache state. For this attack to be efficient attacker would have to
+# effectively slow down the operation by several *orders* of magnitude,
+# by ratio of time slice to duration of handful of AES rounds, which
+# unlikely to remain unnoticed. Not to mention that this also means
+# that he would spend correspondingly more time to collect enough
+# statistical data to mount the attack. It's probably appropriate to
+# say that if adversary reckons that this attack is beneficial and
+# risks to be noticed, you probably have larger problems having him
+# mere opportunity. In other words suggested code design expects you
+# to preclude/mitigate this attack by overall system security design.
+# 2. Attacker manages to make his code interrupt driven. In order for
+# this kind of attack to be feasible, interrupt rate has to be high
+# enough, again comparable to duration of handful of AES rounds. But
+# is there interrupt source of such rate? Hardly, not even 1Gbps NIC
+# generates interrupts at such raging rate...
+#
+# And now back to the former, hyper-threading CPU or more specifically
+# Intel P4. Recall that asynchronous attack implies that malicious
+# code instruments itself. And naturally instrumentation granularity
+# has be noticeably lower than duration of codepath accessing S-box.
+# Given that all cache-lines are accessed during that time that is.
+# Current implementation accesses *all* cache-lines within ~50 cycles
+# window, which is actually *less* than RDTSC latency on Intel P4!

+# Longer answer. Main advantage of using mm registers is that movd

+# instructions are twice as many, they can be scheduled every cycle
+# and not every second one when they are operating on xmm register,
+# so that "arithmetic throughput" remains virtually the same. And

+#
+# September 2011.
+#
+# Started as transliteration to "perlasm" the original code has
+# undergone following changes:
+#
+# - code was made position-independent;
+# - rounds were folded into a loop resulting in >5x size reduction
+#   from 12.5KB to 2.2KB;
+# - above was possibile thanks to mixcolumns() modification that
+#   allowed to feed its output back to aesenc[last], this was
+#   achieved at cost of two additional inter-registers moves;
+# - some instruction reordering and interleaving;
+# - this module doesn't implement key setup subroutine, instead it
+#   relies on conversion of "conventional" key schedule as returned
+#   by AES_set_encrypt_key (see discussion below);
+# - first and last round keys are treated differently, which allowed
+#   to skip one shiftrows(), reduce bit-sliced key schedule and
+#   speed-up conversion by 22%;
+# - support for 192- and 256-bit keys was added;
+#
+# Resulting performance in CPU cycles spent to encrypt one byte out
+# of 4096-byte buffer with 128-bit key is:
+#
+#		Emilia's	this(*)		difference
+#
+# Core 2    	9.30		8.69		+7%
+# Nehalem(**) 	7.63		6.88		+11%
+# Atom	    	17.1		16.4		+4%
+# Silvermont	-		12.9
+# Goldmont	-		8.85
+#
+# (*)	Comparison is not completely fair, because "this" is ECB,
+#	i.e. no extra processing such as counter values calculation
+#	and xor-ing input as in Emilia's CTR implementation is
+#	performed. However, the CTR calculations stand for not more
+#	than 1% of total time, so comparison is *rather* fair.

+# As for key schedule conversion subroutine. Interface to OpenSSL
+# relies on per-invocation on-the-fly conversion. This naturally
+# has impact on performance, especially for short inputs. Conversion
+# time in CPU cycles and its ratio to CPU cycles spent in 8x block
+# function is:
+#
+# 		conversion	conversion/8x block
+# Core 2	240		0.22
+# Nehalem	180		0.20
+# Atom		430		0.20
+#
+# The ratio values mean that 128-byte blocks will be processed
+# 16-18% slower, 256-byte blocks - 9-10%, 384-byte blocks - 6-7%,
+# etc. Then keep in mind that input sizes not divisible by 128 are
+# *effectively* slower, especially shortest ones, e.g. consecutive
+# 144-byte blocks are processed 44% slower than one would expect,
+# 272 - 29%, 400 - 22%, etc. Yet, despite all these "shortcomings"
+# it's still faster than ["hyper-threading-safe" code path in]
+# aes-x86_64.pl on all lengths above 64 bytes...

+# Add decryption procedure. Performance in CPU cycles spent to decrypt
+# one byte out of 4096-byte buffer with 128-bit key is:
+#
+# Core 2	9.98
+# Nehalem	7.80
+# Atom		17.9
+# Silvermont	14.0
+# Goldmont	10.2
+#
+# November 2011.

+# Add bsaes_xts_[en|de]crypt. Less-than-80-bytes-block performance is
+# suboptimal, but XTS is meant to be used with larger blocks...
